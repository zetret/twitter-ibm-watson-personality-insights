This is an Android application written by Upendra Rajan to use IBM Watson Personality Insights to analyze public Twitter profiles. 

This application helps you get deeper personality insights from someone's public Twitter profile. You can get insights on several dimensions, including their personality traits, values, needs and even their consumer preferences.

If the user posts in another language, say Spanish, you can specify the input language as Spanish and then analyze their profile. IBM Watson AI currently supports analysis in English, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese and Korean.
